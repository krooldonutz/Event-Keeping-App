# Event Management App with MEAN Stack

## Overview

This is a comprehensive guide to the Event Management App built using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack. The MEAN stack is a popular choice for full-stack development, and this project demonstrates how to create a web application for managing events and bookings. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about MEAN stack development or an experienced developer seeking a practical example, this guide will help you get started.


## Introduction

The Event Management App is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and book events. It covers the basics of full-stack development using the MEAN stack, which consists of:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing event data.
- **Express.js**: A backend framework for building the server and API.
- **Angular**: A frontend framework for creating the user interface.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for running server-side code.

This app demonstrates the integration of these technologies to create a functional event management system.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following software and tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **backend**: Contains the Node.js server code using Express.js.
- **frontend**: Contains the Angular-based user interface.
- **models**: Defines the data models for MongoDB.
- **routes**: Defines the API routes for CRUD operations.
- **views**: Contains Angular components and templates.
- **public**: Static assets for the frontend.

## Backend (Node.js & Express.js)

The backend is responsible for handling API requests and interacting with the database. It uses Express.js to create routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting events. Authentication and authorization can be added as per your requirements.

## Frontend (Angular)

The frontend is built using Angular, which provides a user-friendly interface for users to manage events. It communicates with the backend via HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations.

## Database (MongoDB)

MongoDB is used to store event data. You can define the data schema in the models folder and set up the database connection in the `backend/.env` file.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete events.
- List and filter events by date, category, and location.
- Responsive user interface.
- A page for Text to Speech
- A page for direct translation of between languages and a history of the translations

## Deployment

To deploy this app in a production environment, you'll need to configure your server, set up a production database, and ensure security measures are in place.
